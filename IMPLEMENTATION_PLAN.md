# Payments Service Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

The payments service currently has a solid foundation with the following implemented features:

### âœ… Already Implemented

- **Basic Stripe Integration**: Customer vault, payment methods, charges, refunds, disputes
- **RESTful API**: Clean HTTP endpoints with proper validation
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with migrations and SQLC code generation
- **Basic Webhooks**: Stripe webhook handling
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and API examples

### ðŸ”„ Recently Removed

- **ClickHouse Analytics**: Removed as requested to simplify architecture

### ðŸš§ Needs Implementation

- **Payment Gateway Abstraction**: Support for multiple payment providers
- **Kafka Integration**: Event publishing with Knative CloudEvents
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Tenant isolation and data partitioning
- **Advanced Stripe Features**: Subscriptions, Connect, Tax, Invoices
- **Security & Compliance**: PCI DSS, SOC2, fraud detection
- **Developer Experience**: OpenAPI docs, SDKs, testing framework

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer

**Decision**: Implement abstract interfaces that allow switching between payment providers without changing business logic.

**Rationale**:

- Enables support for multiple payment gateways (Stripe, Paddle, Square, etc.)
- Maintains consistent API contracts across providers
- Allows gradual migration between providers
- Supports the white-label SaaS platform requirements

**Implementation Approach**:

```go
type PaymentGateway interface {
    CreateCustomer(ctx context.Context, req *CustomerRequest) (*Customer, error)
    CreateCharge(ctx context.Context, req *ChargeRequest) (*Charge, error)
    // ... other operations
}

type StripeGateway struct {
    // Stripe-specific implementation
}

type PaddleGateway struct {
    // Paddle-specific implementation
}
```

### 2. Kafka Integration with Knative CloudEvents

**Decision**: Use Kafka for event streaming with Knative CloudEvents format.

**Rationale**:

- Enables real-time event processing for downstream services
- Supports the platform's event-driven architecture
- Provides reliable event delivery and replay capabilities
- Integrates with existing Knative infrastructure

**Event Types**:

- Customer lifecycle events
- Payment processing events
- Subscription and billing events
- Fraud and compliance events

### 3. Multi-tenant Architecture

**Decision**: Implement database-level tenant isolation with tenant context injection.

**Rationale**:

- Supports white-label SaaS platform requirements
- Ensures complete data isolation between customers
- Enables tenant-specific configurations and branding
- Supports per-tenant rate limiting and quotas

**Implementation Approach**:

- Add `tenant_id` column to all tables
- Implement tenant context middleware
- Use row-level security policies
- Support tenant-specific configurations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Evolution

#### Current Schema

```sql
-- customers, payment_methods, charges, refunds tables
-- Basic structure with single-tenant support
```

#### Target Schema

```sql
-- Add tenant_id to all tables
-- Implement row-level security
-- Add tenant-specific indexes
-- Support tenant configurations
```

### Event Publishing Architecture

#### Event Flow

1. **Payment Operation** â†’ Business Logic Service
2. **Event Creation** â†’ CloudEvents format
3. **Kafka Publishing** â†’ Reliable message delivery
4. **Downstream Processing** â†’ Analytics, billing, etc.

#### Event Schema

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "com.magebase.payments.customer.created",
  "source": "/payments/customers",
  "id": "uuid",
  "time": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "customer_id": "cus_123",
    "tenant_id": "tenant_456",
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Multi-tenant Implementation

#### Tenant Context

```go
type TenantContext struct {
    TenantID   string
    TenantInfo *TenantInfo
    Limits     *TenantLimits
}

func TenantMiddleware() fiber.Handler {
    return func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        tenantID := extractTenantID(c)
        tenantCtx := getTenantContext(tenantID)
        c.Locals("tenant", tenantCtx)
        return c.Next()
    }
}
```

#### Database Isolation

```sql
-- Row-level security policies
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON customers
    FOR ALL USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for business logic
